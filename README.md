## üåü Overview

This advanced CRM system combines intelligent web scraping with AI-powered responses to provide comprehensive and accurate information on any query. The system can handle both general news queries and technical programming questions by dynamically searching and aggregating information from trusted sources.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses Google's Gemini 2.0 to generate well-structured, contextual responses
- **Web Scraping Engine**: Intelligent data collection from diverse sources including:
  - **News Sources**: Times of India, Hindustan Times, The Hindu, NDTV, India Today, and more
  - **Technical Sources**: GeeksforGeeks, JavaTPoint, StackOverflow, W3Schools, GitHub, MDN, and more
- **Query Understanding**: Automatically detects whether a query is technical or news-related
- **Conversation History**: Maintains a history of all interactions for future reference
- **Deep Search Mode**: Provides detailed, source-backed responses for important queries
- **Modern Web Interface**: Clean UI with support for markdown formatting in responses

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ 
- Chrome browser (for Selenium)
- Required Python packages

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CRM-2
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API key:
   - Create a `config.py` file with your Gemini API key:
   ```python
   class Config:
       SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
       SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///crm.db"
       GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key"
       SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python
   >>> from app import app, db
   >>> with app.app_context():
   >>>     db.create_all()
   >>> exit()
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## üí° Usage Guide

### Starting a Conversation

1. Enter your query in the input field at the bottom of the screen
2. Toggle "Deep Search" if you want comprehensive, source-backed research
3. Click "Send" or press Enter

### Query Types

- **General News**: "What's happening in Ukraine?", "Today's top news", "Latest updates on climate change"
- **Technical Questions**: "How to implement binary search in Python?", "Explain React hooks", "Java vs Python performance"

### Viewing History

- All conversations are saved and accessible from the sidebar
- Click on any past conversation to view the full exchange
- Delete conversations using the trash icon

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Sources

To add new sources, modify the configuration dictionaries in `scraper.py`:

- For news sources, add to the `source_configs` dictionary
- For technical sources, add to the `tech_source_configs` dictionary

Each source requires:
- URL template
- CSS selectors for articles/results
- Selectors for titles, links, etc.

### Modifying AI Response Format

Adjust the prompt templates in `app.py` to change how responses are structured.
